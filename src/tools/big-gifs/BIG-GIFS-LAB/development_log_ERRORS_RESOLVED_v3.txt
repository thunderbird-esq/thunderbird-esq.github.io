**Feature Updates and Fixes: Scaling & Filters Integration**

1. **Scaling Functionality (Presets)**
   - Implemented dropdown menu with retro system presets: NES, SNES, Genesis, GameBoy.
   - Selecting a preset now correctly updates frame preview and final output resolution.
   - Aspect ratio is preserved during scaling to prevent stretching/squishing of frames.
   - Resolutions automatically update the cell width/height inputs.

2. **Functional Retro Filters**
   - Integrated retro-style filters including:
     - Grayscale
     - Invert
     - NES (palette emulation)
     - GameBoy (palette emulation)
     - Pico-8 (limited color mode)
     - CGA (emulates early PC graphic style)
   - Filters are now applied to both the preview grid and the rendered GIF output.

3. **Bug Fixes**
   - Resolved `applyScaling is not defined` error that occurred on dropdown change.
   - Ensured scaling dropdown logic connects to width/height fields and triggers rerender.
   - Ensured proper referencing of per-frame filters in the GIF render pipeline.

Current status: BIG GIFS is now equipped with dynamic scaling, pixel-art filter options, per-frame customization, drag-and-drop frame reordering, and a fully working preview/playback pipeline. The groundwork is laid for advancing into sprite sheet importing and UX/UI simulation.
